shadcn-ui-builder
Build premium React components using shadcn/ui and shadcn/studio patterns, aligned with the Master Design Spec.
Shadcn UI Builder Skill
Overview
Generate world-class premium React components using shadcn/ui and shadcn/studio. This skill ensures all UI work is aligned with the Swarm Dashboard Master Design Specification.

Vision alignment (Bolt Plan / Master Spec)
Design System: Use the purple accent (--primary: 262 83% 58%) and premium dark theme tokens defined in docs/plans/dashboard/00-MASTER-DESIGN-SPEC.md.
Patterns: Incorporate patterns from Relevance AI (multi-tab sidebars), Devin (knowledge tables), and Phoenix (trace trees).
Premium Assets: Leverage existing premium blocks in /home/yogi/agent_system/shadcn-premium-assets/ and granular components in /home/yogi/agent_system/shadcn-premium-assets/granular-registry/.
Workflow
Reference Registry: Always check the local shadcn-premium-assets for existing high-quality blocks before building from scratch.
Component Structure:
Use lucide-react for icons.
Use framer-motion for micro-animations.
Follow the Geist Sans and Geist Mono typography standards.
Responsive Design: Ensure mobile-first stacking and desktop-first grid layouts.
Integration: Connect components to the backend API layer (FastAPI) via TanStack Query and Zustand stores.
Technical Constraints
No hardcoded absolute paths; use @/components/... aliases.
Strict TypeScript types for all props.
Adhere to the Geist font family established in the project.
Validation
npm run type-check in apps/dashboard (or current frontend app).
Visual verification against the design spec screenshots listed in docs/plans/dashboard/04-SCREENSHOT-DESIGN-MAP.md.
